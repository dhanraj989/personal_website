  <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
  <p> Hello there! Myself Dhanraj, a fourth-year undergraduate student from the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I am a Data Science enthusiast who enjoys studying and analyzing data to gain insights. I've worked with Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and R; libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Selenium, Flask, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy; and software like Anaconda, Jupyter, Visual Studio Code, R studio, and Github. I earned the title of Kaggle Expert by gaining 6 Bronze medals and ranked among the top 1% out of 2.8 lakh kagglers. </p>

        <h3>Image Denoising of Handwritten Devanagari Script Images (Bachelor Thesis Project I)</h3>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Aug 2023 - Nov 2023</p>
        <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</p>
        <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Professor BG Menon, Industrial and Systems Engineering Department, IIT Kharagpur</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The primary aim of this research is to develop and evaluate image-denoising algorithms that can effectively reduce noise in handwritten Devanagari script images.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a denoising dataset utilizing IIIT-HW-Dev Dataset for ground truth images and generated corresponding noise images by adding Gaussian, Salt and Pepper, Poisson, and Speckle noises</li>
            <li>Trained PRIDNet, RIDNet, Boosted Residual Dense UNet, and Pix2Pix GAN models on a smaller denoising dataset made by combining two datasets, SIDD and RENOIR</li>
            <li>Took 2 architectures that performed well on the smaller dataset; fine-tuned them on the created denoising dataset, also trained both architectures from scratch on the denoising dataset created</li>
            <li>Obtained an impressive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of about 38dB for the best architecture on the test dataset</li>
        </ul>
